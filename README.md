 ⚡ Electricity Production Prediction - SARIMAX

This project focuses on forecasting electricity production using the SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables)model. 
It is designed to analyze historical electricity production data and generate accurate short- and long-term forecasts, taking into account both seasonal patterns and external influencing factors.

📈 Project Overview

- 📊 Time Series Forecasting: Uses SARIMAX to model and predict future electricity production based on historical data.
- ⏱️ Seasonality Awareness: The model captures daily, weekly, or yearly seasonality in electricity production.
- 🌐 Exogenous Variables Support: Incorporates additional features (like temperature, holidays, or demand) to improve prediction accuracy.

🔧 Features

- ✅ Data preprocessing, missing value handling, and resampling
- ✅ Automatic SARIMAX model selection and fitting
- ✅ Forecast visualization with confidence intervals
- ✅ Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, etc.
- ✅ Optional support for multivariate time series (with exogenous features)
